### Install dependencies 
Run yarn in your terminal
```
yarn 
```

### Start the server and webpack in dev mode
Open 2 separate terminal windows. One for the server and the other for webpack 
Terminal window 1 run:
```
yarn start:server
```
Terminal window 2 run:

```
yarn start:dev
```
I'll consolidate this into one start script at some point in the future
